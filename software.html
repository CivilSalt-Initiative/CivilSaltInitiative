                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute
                            specific tasks. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and
                            programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer.
                            The two main categories of software are application software and system software. An
                            application is software that fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. System software is
                            designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top
                            of.
                            Other types of software include programming software, which provides the programming tools
                            software developers need; middleware, which sits between system software and applications;
                            and driver software, which operates computer devices and peripherals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Examples and types of software
                            among the various categories of software, the most common types include the following:
                            <br>
                            • <b>Application software.</b> The most common type of software, application software is a
                            computer software package that performs a specific function for a user, or in some cases,
                            for another application. An application can be self-contained, or it can be a group of
                            programs that run the application for the user. Examples of modern applications include
                            office suites, graphics software, databases and database management programs, web browsers,
                            word processors, software development tools, image editors and communication platforms.
                            <br>
                            • <b>System software.</b> These software programs are designed to run a computer's
                            application programs and hardware. System software coordinates the activities and functions
                            of the hardware and software. In addition, it controls the operations of the computer
                            hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the other types of software to work
                            in. The OS is the best example of system software; it manages all the other computer
                            programs. Other examples of system software include the firmware, computer language
                            translators and system utilities.
                            <br>
                            • <b>Driver software.</b> Also known as device drivers, this software is often considered a
                            type of system software. Device drivers control the devices and peripherals connected to a
                            computer, enabling them to perform their specific tasks. Every device that is connected to a
                            computer needs at least one device driver to function. Examples include software that comes
                            with any nonstandard hardware, including special game controllers, as well as the software
                            that enables standard hardware, such as USB storage devices, keyboards, headphones and
                            printers.
                            <br>
                            • <b>Middleware.</b> The term middleware describes software that mediates between
                            application and system software or between two different kinds of application software. For
                            example, middleware enables Microsoft Windows to talk to Excel and Word. It is also used to
                            send a remote work request from an application in a computer that has one kind of OS, to an
                            application in a computer with a different OS. It also enables newer applications to work
                            with legacy ones.
                            <br>
                            • <b>Programming software.</b> Computer programmers use programming software to write code.
                            Programming software and programming tools enable developers to develop, write, test and
                            debug other software programs. Examples of programming software include assemblers,
                            compilers, debuggers and interpreters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h3><b>How does software work?</b></h3><br>
                            All software provides the directions and data computers need to work and meet users' needs.
                            However, the two different types -- application software and system software -- work in
                            distinctly different ways. <br><br>
                            <b>Application software</b>
                            Application software consists of many programs that perform specific functions for end
                            users, such as writing reports and navigating websites. Applications can also perform tasks
                            for other applications. Applications on a computer cannot run on their own; they require a
                            computer's OS, along with other supporting system software programs, to work.
                            These desktop applications are installed on a user's computer and use the computer memory to
                            carry out tasks. They take up space on the computer's hard drive and do not need an internet
                            connection to work. However, desktop applications must adhere to the requirements of the
                            hardware devices they run on.
                            Web applications, on the other hand, only require internet access to work; they do not rely
                            on the hardware and system software to run. Consequently, users can launch web applications
                            from devices that have a web browser. Since the components responsible for the application
                            functionality are on the server, users can launch the app from Windows, Mac, Linux or any
                            other OS. <br><br>
                            
                            <b>System software</b>
                            System software sits between the computer hardware and the application software. Users do
                            not interact directly with system software as it runs in the background, handling the basic
                            functions of the computer. This software coordinates a system's hardware and software so
                            users can run high-level application software to perform specific actions. System software
                            executes when a computer system boots up and continues running as long as the system is on.
