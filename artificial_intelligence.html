                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Artificial Intelligence is the branch of computer science that deals with the making of
                            intelligent machines. These machines have the capability of performing actions that would
                            otherwise require human intelligence. AI as a service is outperforming humans in many ways.
                            AI is helping in automating the tasks in businesses, industries, manufacturing sectors and
                            many more. <br>
                            Artificial Intelligence is of two types- Narrow or weak AI and Strong AI.
                            <br> <br>
                            <b> Narrow AI:</b> Narrow or weak Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the phenomena in which
                            machines
                            are programmed to perform some specific task only. Narrow AI machines are not that
                            intelligent; as they can perform single specific task only.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Strong AI:</b> Strong AI, on the other hand, is the phenomena in which machines are built
                            that
                            can actually simulate the human intelligence. These machines can adapt themselves to the
                            environment and various types of inputs. These can react differently to different
                            situations.
                            <br><br>
                            Machine Learning and Deep Learning are two subcategories of AI. Let us discuss them in
                            brief...
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Machine Learning:</b> Machine learning is the sub-branch of Artificial Intelligence.
                            Machine
                            learning is the ability of machines to learn on their own. Machine learning gives the
                            ability of reasoning, decision making, problem-solving to the machines.
                            Data science consulting and Artificial Intelligence algorithms are enabling machines to
                            learn from their past experience. Machine learning platforms are mainly used in prediction
                            systems as well as in the classification of products. All the technology giants like Google,
                            Microsoft, Facebook, <b>CivilSalt</b> are making use of Machine Learning.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Deep Learning:</b> Deep Learning is the sub-branch of Machine Learning. Deep learning is
                            inspired by the working of the human brain. The human brain consists of billions of layers
                            of neural networks providing the capability of learning and decision making. Deep Learning
                            imitates the human brain neural network by building artificial neural networks. Deep
                            learning networks give the thinking ability to machines by providing weight and biasing to
                            the input variables.<br><br>
                            On the basis of operations, Artificial Intelligence machines are of following four types:
                            <br><br>
                            <b>1. Reactive Machines AI:</b> Reactive machines AI is the most basic type of AI machines.
                            These
                            machines are purely reactive. They do not have the ability to store data as it does not have
                            memories. Also, it cannot learn from the past experience. The classic example of a reactive
                            machine is the Deep Blue- IBM’s chess-playing supercomputer which defeated the grandmaster
                            at that time Garry Kasparov in 1990’s.
                            Deep Blue was trained with the rules of the Chess and how each piece moves. It can only
                            analyze the current situation. Its moves were dependent on the current positions of its
                            pieces as well as opponent’s pieces. This type of intelligence is not based on the memory
                            and cannot learn from past experience.
                            <br>
                            <b>2. Limited Memory AI:</b> These type of AI machines can have the memory but the memory is
                            limited. Self-driving Cars is the perfect example of limited memory AI. Artificial
                            intelligence as a service has helped in the development of limited memory AI. Self-driving
                            cars have to memorize the directions, observe other cars, identifying distractions and
                            objects in the path etc. But this information no permanently stored in the memory. So, it
                            cannot contribute to the experience of the car, unlike humans who can gain experience over
                            the time.
                            <br>
                            <b>3. Theory of Mind:</b> Theory of mind is a very advanced technology. These are the next
                            level
                            machines that are more advanced. These machines have memories and they can behave and talk
                            like humans, roam the streets. They have the capability to form the society like we do. They
                            have the ability to understand people, objects, and other living creatures.
                            <br>
                            <b>4. Self-Awareness AI:</b> These type of AI machines is self- aware. They are clear about
                            what
                            they want. They are clear about their internal state and also are able to predict the
                            feelings of others also. They have a sense of understanding also. They can empathize and
                            make a relation with the humans. But we are far away from creating these type of machines.
                            Our main focus should be on the more intelligent machines that can learn from past behavior.

                        <br>
                        <b>Expert Systems:</b> Expert systems built using artificial intelligence service incorporates
                        human intelligence with the artificial intelligence. These systems have the ability to advise
                        the businesses or individuals based on prediction and history data analysis.
                        <br>
                        <b>Computer vision:</b> Computer vision has the ability to understand, interpret and analyze the
                        visual inputs given to the computer system. For example, advanced vision systems for the doctors
                        to diagnose the patients. Computer vision systems are used in number plate recognition systems
                        and face recognition systems.
                        <br>
                        <b>Speech Recognition:</b> Artificial intelligence applications are able to understand
                        comprehend and interpret the meaning behind the words spoken by humans. AI systems can
                        understand the meaning behind the sentences. Also, it can understand various languages, slangs,
                        accents etc.
                        <br>
                        <b>Handwriting Recognition:</b> With the help of data science consulting companies, it has
                        become possible for the computer systems to understand the human handwriting. It can match the

                        <h3>Advantages of Artificial intelligence</h3><br>
                        There are numerous advantages of using Artificial Intelligent machines. Artificial intelligence
                        service has found its application in many industries due to its advantages. Some of the
                        advantages of artificial intelligence are:
                        <br>
                        • Artificial Intelligence machines reduce the error in the operations. They are highly accurate
                        and have a high degree of precision.
                        <br>
                        • Robotics and Artificial Intelligence as a service have helped in the exploration of gold
                        mines, crude oils, and oceans. As artificial intelligence machines can work in any environment,
                        exploration becomes easier.
                        <br>
                        • AI reduces the risk factor as they can perform tasks that involve risk to the lives of humans.
                        Like working at dizzy heights and working with sharp-edged tools etc.
                        <br>
                        • Artificial Intelligence is good digital assistants also. They can interact with the user in
                        the form of text, speech or biometrics. They can perform simple tasks that a human assistant
                        would do.
                        <br>
                        • Machines do not require breaks as they do not get tired. Machines can perform continuously for
                        a long time without getting bored.
